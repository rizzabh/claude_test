# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized method for extending AI model capabilities through external context and tools. This repository provides examples and documentation on implementing and using MCP.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol allows AI models to:
- Access external data and resources
- Perform computations outside their context window
- Interact with external systems and tools
- Maintain persistent state across sessions

## How MCP Works

MCP follows a simple client-server architecture:

1. **Client**: The client (typically an AI application) sends requests to an MCP server.
2. **Server**: The MCP server processes these requests and provides the model with additional context or tools.
3. **Protocol**: A standardized JSON-based protocol defines how clients and servers communicate.

## Core Components

### MCP Server

An MCP server implements one or more capabilities that extend the model's functionality:

- **Tools**: Execute code, perform calculations, access databases
- **Context**: Retrieve relevant information from external sources
- **Memory**: Store and retrieve conversation history or other data
- **Reflection**: Allow models to review and improve their responses

### MCP Client

MCP clients integrate with AI models to:
- Format requests in the MCP protocol
- Send requests to appropriate MCP servers
- Integrate responses back into the model's context

## Implementing MCP

To implement MCP in your application:

1. Set up an MCP server with desired capabilities
2. Configure your application to communicate with the server
3. Structure prompts to enable the model to use the MCP capabilities effectively

## Getting Started

To get started with MCP in this repository:

```bash
# Install MCP server via npx or uvx
npx @anthropic/mcp-server

# Or install a local MCP server
npm install
npm start
```

## Benefits of MCP

- **Extensibility**: Add new capabilities to models without retraining
- **Reduced Hallucination**: Ground model outputs in external data
- **Tool Use**: Enable models to use specialized tools and APIs
- **Stateful Interactions**: Maintain context across multiple interactions

## Example Use Cases

- Document question-answering systems
- Data analysis applications
- Multi-step reasoning tasks
- Agents that interact with external APIs
